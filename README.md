# Open Dashboard

> Stop building the same backend dashboard for the hundredth time. Start shipping faster.

If you're like most developers, you've probably built the backend dashboard for a SaaS/App a dozen times. It's always the same stuff: auth, data tables, settings, user profiles... It gets repetitive, and most starters out there are either just pretty UI kits with no real logic, or they look incredibly... well, cliche.

**Open Dashboard** is different. It's an open-source, production-ready starter designed to give you a massive head start, not just a design file.

## Why Another Dashboard Template?

### This is NOT just a pretty frontend

We're not just giving you some static HTML/CSS components. This is a **production-ready foundation** with real, working features. The goal is to get you from idea to launch faster, without sacrificing quality or features.

### Modular design that feels like LEGO

We designed it so that building complex UIs is dead simple. Want a feature-rich table with server-side pagination, filtering, and sorting? It's basically like crafting a toy. You just plug in the module and connect your data.

### A UI you won't get sick of

We put a ton of effort into making an interface that is aesthetically designed, clean, and modern. You can finally have a backend that looks as good as your marketing site. No more boring, cookie-cutter admin panels.

```

## Available Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `bun run build` - Build for production
- `bun run start` - Start production server
- `bun run lint` - Run Biome linter
- `bun run format` - Format code with Biome
- `bun run create-page` - Scaffold a new page (custom script)

## Dashboard Pages

The template includes several example pages demonstrating common patterns:

- **Main Dashboard** - Overview with charts and key metrics
- **Simple Table** - Basic data table implementation
- **Pagination** - Table with server-side pagination
- **Actions** - Table with row actions
- **Compound** - Complex table with multiple features
- **Selectables** - Table with row selection and bulk actions
- **Rich Cell** - Table with custom cell rendering (progress bars, avatars, etc.)
- **Product Management** - Full CRUD example
- **Settings** - User settings page

## Authentication

The template intentionally keeps authentication simple: only a single administrator
account can access the dashboard via `/login`. Self-service registration, password
reset, and social login flows have been removed to reduce complexity.

### Configure administrator credentials

Set the credentials through environment variables (e.g. in a `.env` file):

```
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme123
ADMIN_NAME=Administrator
```

If you omit these variables the defaults above are used. Update them before
deploying so only your chosen admin can sign in.

## Customization

### Adding New Pages

Use the custom page scaffolding script:

```bash
bun run create-page
```

### Modifying the Sidebar

Edit `src/lib/sidebar-items.ts` to add or remove sidebar navigation items.

### Customizing Theme

Modify `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/lib/color-theme.ts` for theme customization.

### Path Mapping

TypeScript is configured with path mapping for cleaner imports:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@/components/Component'
import { util } from '@/lib/util'
```

## Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
bun run build
bun run start
```

### Deploy to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy is using [Vercel](https://vercel.com):
